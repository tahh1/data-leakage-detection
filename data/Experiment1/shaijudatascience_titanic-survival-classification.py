# # 1.Problem Statement
# 
# * Titanic has became one of the most famous ships in the history.
# * One of the unexcepted event is the wreck of Titanic On April 15,1912 after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City.
# * Unfortunately, there werenâ€™t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
# * While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
# * The challenge is to find the survival status of passengers using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).  
# 
# 

# # 2.Overview of Dataset
# 
# There are two sets of data available in the data directory
# 
#  1.training set (train.csv) use to build machine learning model.
#  
#  2.test set (test.csv) use to prdict the built model.

# # 5.Univariate Analysis

# In[18]:


train_df['Survived'].value_counts().plot.bar()


# * The bar chart explains less number of passengers survived in the shipwrecks.

# In[16]:


train_df['Pclass'].value_counts().plot.bar()


# * The variable Pcclass illustrates largest number of passengers booked 3rd class ticket.
# 
# * The second largest number of passengers booked 1st class ticket and remaining passengers booked by 2nd class ticket.
# 
# * In addition to that if more number of passengers travelled in 3 rd class are lesser chance for survival.

# In[17]:


train_df['SibSp'].value_counts().plot.bar()


# In[18]:


train_df['Parch'].value_counts().plot.bar()


# * The variable Sibsp indicates number of passengers on boarded with their siblings and spouses.
# * The variable Parch recorded number of passengers on boarded with their parents and children.
# * Both variable are following the similar shape of distributions.
# * Larger number of people on boarded as single passengers. 

# In[19]:


train_df['Sex'].value_counts().plot.bar()


# * The shortest bar indicates that less number of female passengers onboarded in RMS Titanic.

# In[13]:


train_df['Embarked'].value_counts(normalize=True).plot.bar()


# * Around 70% of passengers embarked from S(Southampton) port.
# * Around 20% of passengers embarked from C(Cherbourg) port and remaining passengers embarked from C (Cherbourg) port.

# In[14]:


sns.distplot(train_df['Fare'],color="m", ) 


# * The distribution of Fare variable is right skewed which means more number of passengers chosen 3 rd class where the ticket price is comparetevely less as compared to 2nd and 1 st class.

# In[15]:

sns.distplot(train_df['Age'],color="m", )

# * It is intersting to see that around 74% of female passengers survived.
# * This information conveys a larger number of male passengers were not evacuated because the protocol follws "children and women" loaded first on the lifeboats.

# In[19]:


#draw a bar plot of survival by Pclass

print(("Percentage of Pclass = 3 who survived:", train_df["Survived"][train_df["Pclass"] == 3].value_counts(normalize = True)[1]*100))


# * Passengers travelled in the first class accommodation has highest percentage of survival followed by 2nd and 3rd class passengers. 

# In[20]:


#draw a bar plot for SibSp vs. survival
sns.barplot(x="SibSp", y="Survived", data=train_df)

print(("Percentage of SibSp = 2 who survived:", train_df["Survived"][train_df["SibSp"] == 2].value_counts(normalize = True)[1]*100))


# * The order of survival is higher for passengers with one,two and no siblings/spouses.
# * Remaining passengers have less survival rate.

# In[21]:


#draw a bar plot for Parch vs. survival
sns.barplot(x="Parch", y="Survived", data=train_df)
plt.show()


# * Passengers with parents/children has highest survival rate in number 3 as compared to number 1 and 2.
