# We find that there are missing values for 'Age', and 'Cabin'. 'Embarked' has a couple of missing values which shouldn't be an issue. 
# 
# I'm a bit curious so let's take a look at the rows that have the 'Embarked parameter missing. Perhaps we can use features in these rows and others to determine what the value of embarking point would have been.

df[df['Embarked'].isna()]


# Interesting, both passengers stayed were in the same cabin, belonged to first class, and survived! After some googling, I learnt that Miss Amelie was the maid to Mrs. Stone and they both boarded from Southamption.

# Now, let's take a closer look at our features individually to observe their raw distribution.

# In[6]:


df['Age'].plot(kind='hist')


# This tells us most of the people aboard the Titanic (or to be accurate, in this dataset) were in the age range of ~18-30, and we have a continuos decrease in frequency as we increase our age. Let us look at the distribution of the 'Age' feature in some more ways using methods available in Pandas.

# In[7]:


df['Age'].describe()


# You could also use df['Age'].value_counts(). These functions do a great job of giving us more information regarding the most common values held, mean, standard deviation, etc. 
# 
# However, we humans (most of us?) are much better at getting a quick perception and summary of the data using visualizations. So now, let's create multiple plots so that we can observe the raw distribution of all relevant features in the same figure.

# Right then, so now we know that most of people died, the number of men are twice as many as the women, most people belonged to the Ticket Class 3, did not travel with their siblings/spouses/parents/children, and embarked from Southampton. All this with a quick glance! You will notice I used percentage notion instead o just raw numbers, as this gives a better perception regarding the distribution :-)
# 
# We can expand this work establish relationships between independent features, if any. For example, what is the survival rate based on gender, or ticket class? To observe these bivariate relationships, let's use a similar subplot structure like we used to view the univariate distributions above.

# We are really starting to spot some trends with these graphs.
# 
# 1. From the first row of graphs, it is easy to see that the survival rate for men is much lower than that of women on the ship.
# 2. The ticket class has a role to play as well. The older you are, the likelier it is that you were able to get a higher class seat. The plot adjacent to it shows that the first class had more people surviving than dying while quite the opposite was true for passengers of class 3.
# 3. The first two plots of the third row show likelihood of survival for rich women (ticket class 1) and poor men (ticket class 3). An analysis based on fare would be interesting as well.
# 4. From the kde plot, you can see that there if you were under a certain age, you had a higher chance for survival. The bar graphs in row 3 and 4 show that if you had some family, your chances of survival were better than the passenger who had no family on board

# From the above graphs, one can make a simple model, predict all women to survive. This will be an appropriate first submission before using any algorithms. It gives a score of 0.76555, a strong improvement on a coin toss. But our model wouldn't really be anything to boast about. For that, we must use some learning algorithms. But before that, we should try to perform some feature engineering on our dataset. The *Name* column is a good place to begin our experimentation at.

# In[10]:


# Extract the titles from names
titles = df['Name'].str.extract(' ([A-za-z]+)\.', expand=False)

# Create a dataframe of titles and survival
titles_df = pd.DataFrame()
titles_df['Title'] = titles
titles_df['Survived'] = df['Survived']


# In[11]:


# Have a look at the raw numbers
titles_df.groupby(['Title', 'Survived']).size().unstack().T


# Great, but it will be better if we plot this information. Most of the titles here have only one or two values so let's use value_counts to find the most common titles 

# In[12]:


titles_df['Title'].value_counts().head(6)


# Right then, let's plot the survival of passengers with the above titles and see if we can spot something

# In[13]:


mask_titles = ['Mr', 'Miss', 'Mrs', 'Master', 'Rev', 'Dr']
titles_df = titles_df.loc[titles_df['Title'].isin(mask_titles), :]

plt.show()


# Beautiful, this shows us as that all passengers with title 'Rev' did not survived while passengers with title 'Mrs' and 'Miss' had a much higher likelihood  of survival. This added information could be useful for our model. Let's see if we can engineer some more features

# Before we fit our model to the training data, however, we must perform the following steps:
# 
# 1. Fill in missing values with an average representation of that feature in the dataset. 
# 2. Categorical variables like 'Sex', 'Embarked', etc. need to be converted to numeric values for the learning algorithm.
# 3. Add the engineered features
# 4. Drop meaningless features/columns
# 5. Perform [one hot encoding](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-one-hot-encoding-why-and-when-do-you-have-to-use-it-e3c6186d008f) so that the linear model can perform better.
# 6. Import different classifiers

# First, let's import our models and helper functions. I will primarily be using the [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) libray

# * Now, let's write some functions to help clean our data. We want these to be generic and pragmatic. Note, that the test set also needs to go through the same steps. We should therefore, combine the training and test data
# 
# * I will read the training data again and start modifying it. The reason for this is that I want to always be able to access the unmodified training data, stored in variable *df*. I could have just used *df.copy()* but this dataset is small and reading it again is a foolproof way of ensuring the data has not been maligned in any of the above steps.
